## User Registration API Endpoint Documentation

### `/user/register`

**Description:** This endpoint allows new users to register on the platform.

**Request Type:** `POST`

**Request Body (Example):**

```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
```

**Request Body (Details):**

*   **username:**  (String, required) The desired username for the new user. Must be unique.
*   **email:**  (String, required) The user's email address. Must be unique and valid.
*   **password:** (String, required) The user's password.  Should meet minimum complexity requirements (e.g., length, character types).


**Files:**

*   `/user/routes.js`: Defines the route for the `/user/register` endpoint and handles routing logic.  It calls the corresponding controller function.

*   `/user/controller.js`: Contains the controller function that handles the user registration request. It receives the data, validates it, and interacts with the service to register the user.  It then responds with the results.

*   `/user/service.js`:  Provides the business logic for user registration. It interacts with the database (or other data storage mechanisms) to create a new user record.  It handles password hashing and other security considerations.

**Response Codes:**

*   **201 Created:** The user was successfully registered.  Response includes basic user information (e.g., user ID, username).
*   **400 Bad Request:** The request body was invalid (missing fields, invalid data types, etc.) or username/email already exists.
*   **500 Internal Server Error:**  An unexpected error occurred on the server.

**Example Successful Response (201):**

```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": "some_unique_user_id",
    "username": "john_doe"
  }
}
```
